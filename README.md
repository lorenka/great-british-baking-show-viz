## Setup 
### Include the file directly

There is a dependency on D3.js and Scrollama.js
Coming soon, annotations with d3-annotation.js

You must include the [d3 library](http://d3js.org/) before including the annotation file. Then you can add the compiled js file to your website


- [Unminified](https://github.com/susielu/d3-annotation/blob/master/d3-annotation.js)
- [Minified](https://github.com/susielu/d3-annotation/blob/master/d3-annotation.min.js)

### Using CDN

You can add the latest version of [d3-annotation hosted on cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/d3-annotation).

### Using NPM

You can add d3-annotation as a node module by running

```bash
npm i d3-svg-annotation -S
```
